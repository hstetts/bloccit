       <%#topic_post_url is very important b/c when we use _path we get a "relative URL" such as "topics/3"
       This works within context of website b/c browser already knows the base URL.
       But when a user sees this email, they won't be in the app and won't have the base URL. Therefore, we have to define it.
       That is what _url does. It generates an "absolute URL", #%>
       <%= link_to "View Comment on site", topic_post_url(@post.topic, @post, anchor: "comment-#{@comment.id}") %>
     </p>
   </body>
